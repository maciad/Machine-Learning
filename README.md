## Overview

In this course, we delve into the fascinating field of machine learning, which lies at the intersection of computer science and statistics. Machine learning empowers computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for every task. From spam filtering to recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles, machine learning algorithms are ubiquitous in today's world.

## Course Structure

The course is structured to provide a balanced blend of theoretical foundations and practical applications. Each week, we cover a different aspect of machine learning, building upon the knowledge acquired in previous sessions. The course includes lectures, practical exercises, and assignments to reinforce learning and practical skills.

## Topics Covered

Some of the key topics covered in this course include:

- Introduction to Machine Learning
- Supervised Learning (Regression, Classification)
- Unsupervised Learning (Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction)
- Model Evaluation and Validation
- Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- CNNs and RNNs (basic information)

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone or fork it to your local machine. You'll find code samples, assignments, and additional resources organized neatly within the repository. Feel free to explore the materials.
